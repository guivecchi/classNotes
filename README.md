# classNotes
Stores my personal class notes from the 7th to 10th semester of Poli-USP graduation on Electrical Engineering with emphasizes on Computation and Computer Systems. 

All notes will be separated by semester and subject. All notes will be written in Portuguese.

I mostly use MarkDown language for the notes.
